Logo - assets/logo.png

Pages:
home.html - Landing page with a 3d room interactive where users can choose paradoxes by clicking like a 2.5d space
about.html - explanation of all paradoxes in simple terms with reference to wikipedia page
<paradoxname>.html - Paradox page with simulation and charts for visualization

Features: 
- interactive 2d simulations like games
- real time prob charts using chart.JS
- no user accounts or other pages (profile, auth, settings)
- Local storage for tracking visited Paradoxes

Paradoxes - Monty Hall Problem, Birthday Paradox, Braess’s Paradox, Simpson’s Paradox (Parrondo’s Paradox Prisoner’s Dilemma variants if time allows)

User flow:
Landing page -> browse paradoxes -> click paradox -> read setup or guide -> interact with simulation -> see results -> explore explanation -> back to home (Repeat)

Landing Pages ideas - A room or a book room can have paintings which will allow users to go to the ismulation page or um idk maybe a book where the pages turn like in the indie game what remains of edith finch where pages turn and we see new pardoxes where we could go? idk both works will look cool and are really worth it 

Logo Ideas - Maybe a text in 'Oi' Font or idk no logo a question mark perhaps? i want it to be cozy cute indie comic style lol keywords
