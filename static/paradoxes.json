        "description": "You're on a game show. Three doors: one car, two goats. You pick door number 1. The host opens door number 3 and reveals a goat. Now he asks: Switch to door number 2, or stay with number 1? Most people think it doesn't matter. They're wrong. Switching DOUBLES your chances from 33% to 67%!",
        "funFact": "When this appeared in Parade Magazine in 1990, over 10,000 readers including 1,000 PhDs wrote in saying the answer was wrong. Even famous mathematicians initially disagreed with the solution!",

        "date": "Probability Theory",
        "description": "In a room of just 23 random people, there's a 50% chance that two of them share the same birthday. With 70 people, it jumps to 99.9%! Your brain tricks you because you think about YOUR birthday. But the math asks about ANY two people sharing. That changes everything.",
        "funFact": "Cryptographers used this paradox to break hash functions and forge digital signatures. Birthday attacks are a real security threat in computer science. Math is not just puzzles, it's power.",
